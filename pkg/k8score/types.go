// Package k8score provides a shared Kubernetes resource caching layer built on
// SharedInformers. It is designed to be imported by both Radar (the Explorer
// desktop app) and skyhook-connector (the in-cluster agent), extracting the
// common informer setup, transform, lister, and change-notification logic.
//
// This package has NO imports of any internal/ package. Application-specific
// behavior (timeline recording, noisy-resource filtering, diff computation)
// is injected via callbacks in CacheConfig.
